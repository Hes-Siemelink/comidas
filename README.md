## Developer

This repo is structured as an agent-driven development roject and has the following main sections.

1. [spec](spec/) - Contains the specification of the product. This is where the features are defined in markdown text and graphics.
2. [implementation](implementation/) - This is where the actual code lives of the product
3. [agents](agents/) - Contains the defintions of the agents working on the project. Each agent has a different responisibility. For example, one agent distills the work items from the specifications, another does the coding, and we another does validation and test. Just like a real team!
4. [backlog](backlog/) - We do simple backlog management in the repo itself. The advantage is that we don't need to connect to an external system to see the work that is being lined u and we have a record of changes in the git commits.
