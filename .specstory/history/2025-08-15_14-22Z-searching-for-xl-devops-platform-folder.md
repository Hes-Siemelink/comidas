# Searching for XL DevOps Platform folder (2025-08-15 14:22Z)

_**User**_

et's connect to Release! Can you see the XL DevOps Platform folder?

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you connect to Digital.ai Release and look for the XL DevOps Platform folder. Let me start by listing the folders to see what's available. I can see several folders in Digital.ai Release, but I don't see an "XL DevOps Platform" folder specifically. The available folders are:

- **Application Security**
- **Digital.ai - Official** 
- **Product Management**
- **Samples & Tutorials**
- **vanguard-bears**

Let me check if there might be subfolders within these that could contain what you're looking for. Let me also try searching with a bit more depth to see if there are nested folders: I can see the folder structure now with more depth, but I still don't see a folder specifically named "XL DevOps Platform". Let me try searching for it by name to see if it exists but might not be visible in the current listing: The search didn't find a folder named "XL DevOps Platform". Let me also try some variations of the name: I successfully connected to Digital.ai Release, but I don't see an "XL DevOps Platform" folder in the current instance. Here's what I found:

## Available Folders:
1. **Application Security** (with subfolders: Strategic Planning, Environmental Detection, Sandbox)
2. **Digital.ai - Official** (with subfolders: Workflows, Workflow Executions, Templates) 
3. **Product Management** (with subfolders: 2020-Q1, MM3, MM2, MM1 (git), Test)
4. **Samples & Tutorials**
5. **vanguard-bears**

The "XL DevOps Platform" folder doesn't appear to exist in this Digital.ai Release instance. This could be because:

1. **Different instance**: You might be thinking of a different Digital.ai Release environment
2. **Different name**: The folder might have a different name than expected
3. **Permissions**: The folder might exist but not be visible with current permissions
4. **Location**: It might be nested deeper in the folder structure

Would you like me to:
- Explore any of the existing folders in more detail?
- Create a new "XL DevOps Platform" folder if that's what you're looking for?
- Look for templates or releases that might be related to DevOps workflows?

_**Assistant**_

I'll look for and analyze the "XL DevOps Platform (9.7.x and above)" template. Let me first search for templates in the XL DevOps Platform folder. Now let me get the specific template you mentioned by searching for "XL DevOps Platform (9.7.x and above)": Perfect! Now I have the complete template structure. Let me analyze this comprehensive "XL DevOps Platform (9.7.x and above)" template for you:

## Analysis of XL DevOps Platform Release Template

Now we are going to look at the subtemplates. We are going to build a tree of dependencies with this template at the top. Now scan for subtemplates that are being invoked by way of the Create Release Task

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll scan through the XL DevOps Platform template to identify all the subtemplates that are invoked via Create Release Tasks and build a dependency tree.

Let me extract and analyze the Create Release Tasks from the template data: Based on my analysis of the template structure, I've identified several Create Release Tasks that invoke subtemplates. Let me get the details of these referenced templates: Now let me get the other key subtemplates referenced in the main template: Now let me get the Docker images subtemplate: Now let me build the complete dependency tree for the XL DevOps Platform template. I'll create a visualization that shows the hierarchical structure: Perfect! I've now analyzed the complete dependency tree for the XL DevOps Platform template. Here's the comprehensive structure I've discovered:

## üå≥ XL DevOps Platform Release Orchestration Dependency Tree

### **Root Template:**
```
üì¶ XL DevOps Platform (9.7.x and above)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Description: Master orchestration template for XL DevOps Platform releases
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Purpose: Coordinates entire release process from EA to GA with automated workflows
```

### **Level 1 Subtemplates (Direct Dependencies):**

#### **1. Early Access Branch**
```
‚îú‚îÄüìã [Early Access] Post Release Activities
‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Triggered: When Early Access release is selected

```

#### **2. General Availability Branch**
```
‚îú‚îÄüìã [General Availability] Post Release Activities  
‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Triggered: When GA release is selected
‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Purpose: Production release activities and customer notification
‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Key Phases:

‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ **Nested Subtemplate:**
‚îÇ      ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Release New Docker images for XL Release (Level 2)
```

### **Level 2 Subtemplates (Nested Dependencies):**

#### **Docker Image Release Template**
```
‚îî‚îÄüê≥ Release New Docker images for XL Release
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Purpose: Builds and publishes Docker images for XL Release
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Triggered: From both EA and GA workflows
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Key Tasks:
   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Build and push XLRelease Ubuntu images
   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Build and push Redhat images (conditional)
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Variables:
   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ XLR_VERSION (version to release)
   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ releaseType (final, beta, alpha, rc)
   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ releaseRedhatImage (boolean)
   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ registry (target Docker registry)
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Infrastructure: 
       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ xldocker-slave1.xebialabs.com (Ubuntu builds)
       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ xldocker-slave2.xebialabs.com (RHEL builds)
```

## üîÑ Release Flow Patterns

### **Conditional Orchestration:**
- **Early Access Flow**: Main Template ‚Üí EA Post Release ‚Üí Docker Images
- **General Availability Flow**: Main Template ‚Üí GA Post Release ‚Üí Docker Images
- **Variable-Driven**: Release type determines which subtemplates are invoked

### **Key Integration Points:**
1. **Create Release Tasks**: Primary mechanism for subtemplate invocation
2. **Variable Inheritance**: Parent templates pass configuration to children
3. **Gate Dependencies**: Cross-template synchronization and approval gates
4. **Artifact Flow**: Docker images flow from builds to distribution

### **Infrastructure Dependencies:**
- **Distribution Servers**: nexus.xebialabs.com, dist.xebialabs.com
- **Docker Build Slaves**: xldocker-slave1/2.xebialabs.com  
- **Documentation Pipeline**: Jenkins integration for doc generation
- **Registry Endpoints**: DockerHub, RedHat Connect, internal registries

## üìä Template Relationship Summary

```
XL DevOps Platform (ROOT)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Conditional Branch 1: EA Release
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [Early Access] Post Release Activities
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Docker Images Template
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Conditional Branch 2: GA Release  
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [General Availability] Post Release Activities
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Docker Images Template
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Shared Dependencies:
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Infrastructure servers
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Distribution mechanisms
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Docker build systems
```

This dependency tree reveals a sophisticated enterprise release orchestration system where:

1. **The main template** acts as a decision router based on release type
2. **Subtemplate specialization** handles EA vs GA-specific workflows  
3. **Docker image building** is a shared dependency used by both paths
4. **Variable inheritance** ensures consistent configuration across the hierarchy
5. **Infrastructure abstraction** allows the same templates to work across environments

The system demonstrates advanced Digital.ai Release patterns including conditional flows, nested template invocation, cross-template dependencies, and infrastructure-aware automation.

Can you dig a level deeper

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll dig deeper into the dependency analysis by examining more subtemplates and looking for additional Create Release Tasks that might invoke even more nested templates. Let me search for more dependencies in the templates we've already retrieved. Let me examine the main XL DevOps Platform template more carefully to find all Create Release Tasks that I might have missed:
