# Backlog management and multi-agent development approach (2025-08-18 07:56Z)

_**User**_

I am going to pitch the way we do backlog management in this project for an internal 5 minute presentation. I want to tell how I set up the agents and the backlog in this project. The contents of the project itself ("Comidas") are not so relevant for the presentation, it's more about the way of working. Please create a pitch of 200 words max introducing the approach and highlighting benefits. Please use a concise and neutral writing style and don't repeat yourself.

# Multi-Agent Development with Structured Backlog Management

Our project implements a **multi-agent AI development approach** that mirrors real software teams through specialized roles and responsibilities.

## Agent Structure
- **Planner Agent**: Analyzes requirements and manages backlog organization
- **Coder Agent**: Implements features, writes tests, handles git workflow
- **Architect Agent**: Provides technical guidance and reviews architecture
- **Product Owner**: Defines requirements and gates quality (human-in-the-loop)

## Backlog Organization
Stories flow through structured directories: `todo` → `doing` → `done`, with additional `epic` and `later` sections. Each agent follows specific protocols for moving work items and requesting approvals.

## Key Benefits
- **Clear Accountability**: Each agent has defined responsibilities and decision-making authority
- **Quality Gates**: Product Owner approval required before completion ensures requirements are met
- **Traceability**: Git commits include agent attribution and structured messaging
- **Scalability**: Human oversight focuses on high-value decisions rather than mechanical tasks
- **Consistency**: Standardized workflows reduce context switching and improve predictability

This approach transforms AI development from ad-hoc interactions into a structured, collaborative process that maintains quality while enabling autonomous progress tracking and implementation.

OK replace the Agent Structure section with a paragraph of text (no bullet points) that introduces the concept of using agents and mentions the planner, coder and architect agent.

# Multi-Agent Development with Structured Backlog Management

Our project implements a **multi-agent AI development approach** that distributes development work across specialized AI agents, each with distinct responsibilities similar to a real software team. The Planner Agent analyzes requirements and organizes the backlog, the Coder Agent implements features and manages git workflow, while the Architect Agent provides technical guidance and reviews architecture decisions. This creates a collaborative AI ecosystem where human oversight focuses on high-value Product Owner decisions rather than mechanical implementation tasks.

## Key Benefits
This approach creates clear accountability since each agent knows exactly what they're responsible for and when to make decisions. Quality stays high because the Product Owner still gates what gets shipped, but now they focus on the important stuff rather than nitpicky details. Everything gets tracked properly through git commits that show which agent did what, making it easy to trace how features evolved. The whole thing scales better because humans only need to weigh in on strategic decisions while the agents handle the routine implementation work. Most importantly, it brings consistency to what used to be chaotic AI interactions by establishing standardized workflows that everyone follows.

This approach transforms AI development from ad-hoc interactions into a structured, collaborative process that maintains quality while enabling autonomous progress tracking and implementation.

Last sentence should be concise and snappy. Rewrite and get rid of the part after "while enabling..."

Describe how the backlog is organized in three sentences

---

_**Assistant**_

The backlog is organized into five main directories that represent the flow of work: `epic` for high-level stories, `todo` for upcoming features, `doing` for work in progress, `done` for completed items, and `later` for deferred ideas. Stories move through the structured pipeline from `todo` → `doing` → `done` as agents complete their work, with each agent following specific protocols for moving items between stages. Each section includes a `README.md` for guidance, and agents must request Product Owner approval before moving stories to the "done" stage.

Now this is what I ended up writing in the end. Please help me by suggesting a prompt that would lead you to produce a similar text
---
I am experimenting with a software development approach that uses specialized AI agents, similar to a real software team. The Planner Agent analyzes requirements and creates stories. The Coder Agent implements features in code and tests them. The Architect Agent provides technical guidance and reviews architecture decisions. 

At its heart it has a simple backlog system, where stories flow from "to do" to "doing" to "done".

The agents own the stories and move them around in the workflow.

The human has the role of Product Owner, and validates and approves stories before they are completed.

This brings consistency and focus to the work being done and transforms AI development from ad-hoc chaos into structured feature delivery. 

---

_**Assistant**_

Here's a prompt that would likely produce similar text:

**"I need to write a brief pitch (under 100 words) about our multi-agent AI development approach for an internal presentation. Focus on the practical workflow rather than technical details. The key points are: we use specialized AI agents (Planner, Coder, Architect) that work like a real dev team, stories flow through a simple todo→doing→done backlog, agents own and move their work items, and humans act as Product Owner for final approval. Emphasize how this creates structure and consistency compared to typical chaotic AI interactions. Use conversational, direct language and focus on the transformation from chaos to organized delivery."**

The key elements that would guide toward your final text:
- Emphasis on "brief pitch" and word limit
- Focus on "practical workflow" over technical complexity  
- Specific mention of the three agent types and their roles
- Highlighting the simple backlog flow
- Agent ownership concept
- Human-as-Product-Owner role
- The "chaos to structure" transformation theme
- Request for "conversational, direct language"
