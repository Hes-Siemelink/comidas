# Home page specification and functional behavior details (2025-08-19 16:58Z)

_**User**_

You are now the Product Owner. I want you to update the spec. Create a page spec/home-page.md and describe the goal and the functional behavior of the page. Describe all sections on the page in a functional way. A section is logical grouping of UI components, for example "The language selection section". The description should not focus on specific UI or layout questions. For example good: "The selected language is highlighted" and bad: "The select language is a blue button with white text". Do this for all sections and elements on the page. Do this in such a way that another LLM agent or builder app like Lovabale or Base 44 could pick up the spec and reimplemented. Also describe behavior. For example "When you click on the Meal planner button, you navigate to the Meal planner page". Describing other pages is out of scope. You can use the stories in backlog/done and the code in implementation/comidas-app/src.

---

_**Assistant**_

The specification for the Home Page has been created in `home-page.md`. It describes the goal, all functional sections, and their behaviors in a way that is implementation-agnostic and suitable for any builder agent or app. Let me know if you need further updates or want to review the spec.

---

_**User**_

Now create a page domain-objects.md that explain the main logical entities of the application. First do a scan of the functionality and propose which concepts to describe

---

_**Assistant**_

Here are the main logical entities (domain objects) in the comidas application, based on the functional scan of the meal planner and recipe database features:

1. **Week**  
Represents a planning period for meals. Contains metadata (title, status), a list of meals, and tracks completion.

2. **Meal**  
Represents a single meal entry within a week. Contains a name, completion status, and may link to a recipe.

3. **Recipe**  
Represents a recipe in the database. Contains a name, ingredients, instructions, and may be linked to meals.

4. **Language**  
Represents the user's selected language for localization.

5. **User Preferences**  
Represents persistent user settings, such as selected language and possibly other configuration.

Would you like a detailed description of each domain object in the new `domain-objects.md` page?

---

_**User**_

yes

---

_**Assistant**_

The domain objects specification has been created in `domain-objects.md`. It describes the main entities—Week, Meal, Recipe, Language, and User Preferences—with their properties and behaviors in a way that is implementation-agnostic and suitable for any builder agent or app. Let me know if you need further updates or want to review the spec.

---

_**User**_

Now update spec/recipe-database-page.md with the same instructions I gave your for the home page. Add a link from spec/home-page.md to this page when it's mentioned for the first time on that page

---

_**Assistant**_


```

```

```

```
Both specifications are now updated:

- `recipe-database-page.md` describes the goal, all sections, and functional behavior in an implementation-agnostic way.
- `home-page.md` now includes a Markdown link to the Recipe Database spec when first mentioned.

Let me know if you need further changes or want to review the updated specs.

---

_**User**_

You also need to describe the behavior. Document the flow of adding a new recipe by pressing the Add New Recipe button. It's OK to refer to UI elements in a common way like 'button', 'input field' etc. Describe the user flow what happens

---

_**Assistant**_


```

```
The behavior and user flow for adding a new recipe are now documented in `recipe-database-page.md`. It describes the steps from pressing the Add New Recipe button, entering details, validation, saving, and canceling. Let me know if you need further updates or want to review the changes.

---

_**User**_

Now add the user flow of editing a recipe

---

_**Assistant**_


```

```
The user flow for editing a recipe has been added to `recipe-database-page.md`. It describes the complete flow from selecting a recipe, entering edit mode, modifying the data, validation, saving, and canceling. The flow is consistent with the add recipe flow but includes the pre-population of existing data and updating behavior.

---

_**User**_

Given home-page.md and recipe-database-page.md, read and update spec/meal-planner-page.md

---

_**Assistant**_

Now I'll rewrite the `meal-planner-page.md` specification to follow the same format as the `home-page.md` and `recipe-database-page.md` specs: 
```

```
Now I need to add a link to the Meal Planner page in the home page spec: 
```

```
The `meal-planner-page.md` has been completely rewritten to follow the same format as the home page and recipe database specs. The specification now includes:

1. **Clear goal and purpose** - focused on meal planning and weekly management
2. **Functional sections** - describing all UI components in terms of behavior rather than appearance
3. **User flows** - detailed step-by-step processes for creating weeks, adding meals, and completing weeks
4. **Implementation-agnostic language** - suitable for any builder agent or app

I also added a link to the Meal Planner page in the home page spec when it's first mentioned, maintaining consistency with the Recipe Database link.

The specification captures all the key functionality from the original document but presents it in a structured, functional way that focuses on what the system does rather than how it looks.

---

_**User**_

Can you keep the original text at the bottom of the file with a note 'original spec'

---

_**Assistant**_


```

```
The original specification text has been preserved at the bottom of the file under an "Original Spec" section. This maintains the historical context and detailed explanations while keeping the new structured specification at the top for implementation purposes.

---

_**User**_

Can you create all documents in the spec directory (except architecture) and tell me if we missed something and if we are reasonably complete (don't write just yet)

---

_**Assistant**_

Let me examine the current spec directory and analyze what documents we have and what might be missing. Based on my analysis of the current spec directory and the `README.md` content, here's what we have and what we might be missing:

## Current Documents:
1. ✅ **`README.md`** - Overall app description and key features
2. ✅ **domain-objects.md** - Core entities (Week, Meal, Recipe, Language, User Preferences)
3. ✅ **`home-page.md`** - Entry point with navigation and status
4. ✅ **`meal-planner-page.md`** - Weekly meal planning functionality
5. ✅ **`recipe-database-page.md`** - Recipe management and browsing
6. ✅ **architecture.md** - (excluded from this analysis per request)

## Missing Documents We Should Consider:

### 1. **cooking-assistant-page.md**
- The README mentions a "Cooking Assistant" as one of the three main features
- Would describe step-by-step cooking mode, timers, recipe modifications
- Currently listed in backlog/later/ but referenced in main app structure

### 2. **navigation-and-routing.md**
- How users navigate between pages
- URL structure and routing behavior
- Back button behavior, deep linking

### 3. **internationalization.md**
- Language switching behavior
- Text localization requirements
- Cultural adaptations (Spanish/Dutch/English)

### 4. **data-persistence.md**
- How data is stored and retrieved
- Offline behavior
- Data synchronization requirements

### 5. **accessibility.md**
- Screen reader support
- Keyboard navigation
- Color contrast and visual accessibility
- Mobile touch accessibility

### 6. **mobile-considerations.md**
- Touch interactions and gestures
- Screen size adaptations
- Performance considerations
- Offline capabilities

## Assessment:

**We are reasonably complete** for the core functionality described in the current backlog. The three main features (Recipe Database, Meal Planner, and Home Page) are well-documented with functional specifications.

**The main gap** is the Cooking Assistant page, which is mentioned as a key feature in the README but not yet specified. However, this aligns with it being in the `` directory.

**For a complete specification suite**, I'd recommend adding the Cooking Assistant page spec and potentially the navigation/internationalization docs, but the current set covers the implemented functionality well.

Would you like me to create any of these missing specifications?

---

_**User**_

Add navigation-and-routing.md and internationalization.md

---

_**Assistant**_

Both specifications have been created:

1. **`navigation-and-routing.md`** - Covers URL structure, navigation patterns, state preservation, accessibility, and error handling for both current web and future mobile implementations.

2. **`internationalization.md`** - Addresses the multilingual requirements for the Mexican-Dutch family, including Spanish, Dutch, and English support with cultural adaptations and technical considerations.

These documents complement the existing page specifications by defining the cross-cutting concerns that affect all parts of the application. They're written in the same implementation-agnostic style as the other specs, focusing on functional requirements rather than specific technical implementation details.
