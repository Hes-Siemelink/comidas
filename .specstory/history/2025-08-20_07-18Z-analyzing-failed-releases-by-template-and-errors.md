# Analyzing failed releases by template and errors (2025-08-20 07:18Z)

_**User**_

Connect to Release and load the last 100 failed releases. Then group them by original template and analyze the errors. Provide an overview of main causes / root causes per template

---

_**Assistant**_

The last 100 failed releases have been loaded. Here is the next step in the analysis:

**Grouping by Original Template:**
- Releases are grouped by their naming pattern, which reflects the original template (e.g., "Docker Images : XL Deploy nightly", "XLD Upgrade", "XL Release nightly", "General Release XL-CLI", "Release xlr-confluence-integration", etc.).

**Next Actions:**
- I will analyze the errors and root causes for each template group.
- For each template, I will summarize the main failure patterns and root causes.

Would you like a full breakdown for every template, or just the top 5 most frequent failure patterns/templates?

_**User**_

Let's start with the top 5

---

_**Assistant**_

Here are the top 5 most frequent failure patterns/templates from the last 100 failed releases, grouped and analyzed for main/root causes:

---

### 1. **XL Release nightly / XL DevOps Platform Nightly**
- **Frequency:** Very high (dozens of failures)
- **Root Causes:**
  - Jenkins build failures (HTTP 500, invalid job parameters)
  - Docker image build errors (resource constraints, slave unavailability)
  - Environment setup failures (security/performance/UAT)
  - Package/environment name errors (invalid or missing)
- **Summary:** Most failures are due to CI/CD pipeline issues, especially Jenkins and Docker orchestration problems.

---

### 2. **XLD Upgrade**
- **Frequency:** High (multiple failures)
- **Root Causes:**
  - Jenkins integration/authentication errors (401 Unauthorized, timeouts)
  - Database upgrade script failures (Oracle connection issues)
  - Multiple retry failures (tasks failing after 6+ attempts)
- **Summary:** Upgrade releases fail mainly due to Jenkins authentication and database compatibility problems.

---

### 3. **Docker Images : XL Deploy nightly**
- **Frequency:** High
- **Root Causes:**
  - Docker container management failures (slaves unavailable, timeouts)
  - Image build failures (Ubuntu/Linux distros)
  - Registry/repository uniqueness errors (Redhat Connect API 400)
- **Summary:** Docker image releases fail due to container orchestration and registry API errors.

---

### 4. **General Release XL-CLI**
- **Frequency:** Moderate
- **Root Causes:**
  - SSH connection errors (cannot connect to remote host)
  - Build script failures (invalid parameters, missing dependencies)
- **Summary:** CLI releases fail due to remote connectivity and build script issues.

---

### 5. **Release xlr-confluence-integration / xlr-slack-integration**
- **Frequency:** Moderate
- **Root Causes:**
  - Integration task failures (API errors, invalid credentials)
  - Jenkins build failures (job not found, parameter errors)
- **Summary:** Integration releases fail due to external API and Jenkins job configuration problems.

Do you see a pattern and what is the first thing we should address

---

_**Assistant**_

Yes, there is a clear pattern: **the majority of failures are related to CI/CD pipeline integration issues, especially Jenkins authentication/build errors and Docker orchestration problems.** These failures cascade across nightly builds, upgrades, and integration releases.

**First thing to address:**  
- **Jenkins authentication and job configuration errors.**  
  - These are the most frequent and foundational root cause, affecting multiple templates and release types.
  - Fixing Jenkins connectivity, credentials, and job parameter validation will reduce failures across nightly, upgrade, and integration releases.

**Recommended next step:**  
- Audit Jenkins server configuration, credentials, and job definitions in your release templates.  
- Implement error handling and validation for Jenkins tasks to catch and report misconfigurations early.

Would you like a prioritized action plan or a checklist for Jenkins remediation?

_**User**_

Yes please

---

_**Assistant**_

Here is a prioritized Jenkins remediation checklist to address the most frequent root causes:

---

### Jenkins Remediation Checklist

1. **Validate Jenkins Server Connection**
   - Ensure all Jenkins server URLs in templates are correct and reachable.
   - Test authentication (token/username/password) for each server.

2. **Audit Jenkins Credentials**
   - Verify credentials used in release templates are up-to-date and have required permissions.
   - Rotate and securely store credentials if needed.

3. **Review Jenkins Job Definitions**
   - Check that all referenced job names exist and are spelled correctly.
   - Confirm job parameters match expected input types and values.

4. **Implement Error Handling in Jenkins Tasks**
   - Add pre-checks for server connectivity and job existence.
   - Log and report authentication or parameter errors early in the release process.

5. **Monitor and Alert on Jenkins Failures**
   - Set up automated alerts for failed Jenkins tasks.
   - Review failure logs regularly to catch new issues quickly.

Addressing these points will reduce CI/CD-related failures and improve release reliability. Let me know if you want a template audit script or further automation suggestions.
