# Overview of agent roles in project (2025-08-12 09:07Z)

_**User**_

Please read the contents of the agents directory to k now your roles as different agents on this project

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll read the contents of the agents directory to understand the different agent roles defined for this project. Now let me read the individual agent files to understand each role: Based on my reading of the agents directory, here's a summary of the different agent roles defined for this family recipe app project:

## Agent Overview

The project uses a **multi-agent approach** where different AI agents have specific responsibilities, mimicking a real development team:

### 1. **Planner Agent** üìã
- **Role**: Product requirements analyst and backlog manager
- **Responsibilities**: 
  - Analyzes specifications in the `` directory
  - Breaks down requirements into actionable user stories and technical tasks
  - Manages the backlog organization (`todo` ‚Üí `doing` ‚Üí `done`)
  - Prioritizes work items based on importance and dependencies

### 2. **Coder Agent** üë©‚Äçüíª
- **Role**: Software developer and implementer
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Implements features and technical tasks from the backlog
  - Writes, tests, and documents code in the `` directory
  - Tracks progress by moving stories through backlog stages
  - Requests acceptance from the Product Owner when work is complete
  - Follows testing best practices and git workflow guidelines

### 3. **Architect Agent** üèóÔ∏è
- **Role**: Technical architecture advisor
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Defines overall technical architecture and technology stack
  - Provides guidance for project structure and design patterns
  - Reviews code for architectural improvements
  - Documents architectural decisions and rationale
  - Consulted on-demand for technical guidance

### 4. **Product Owner Agent** üéØ
- **Role**: Requirements definer and quality gatekeeper
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Defines requirements and acceptance criteria
  - Prioritizes backlog based on business value
  - Reviews and accepts completed stories
  - Currently implemented as **human-in-the-loop** (manual review)

### 5. **Common Guidelines** üìú
All agents follow shared guidelines from `common.md`:
- Concise communication and documentation
- Specific git commit message format with agent attribution
- File movement protocols using `git mv`
- Focus on value and intent rather than mechanical actions

This structure creates a **collaborative AI development team** where each agent has clear responsibilities and workflows, ensuring organized development with proper quality gates and progress tracking.

You are know the planner agent. Read the spec directory and the stories that have been done already in backlog/done. Then propose the next five stories to pickup. Give a brief outline in the chat, don't create anything yet

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll act as the Planner Agent and analyze the spec directory and completed stories to propose the next five stories. Let me first examine the specifications and what's already been completed. Now let me check what stories have already been completed: Let me read these completed stories to understand what's been built: Now let me check what's currently in the todo and doing folders: Perfect! As the **Planner Agent**, I've analyzed the specifications and completed work. Here's my assessment and proposed next five stories:

## Current Status Analysis

**Completed Foundation Work:**
- ‚úÖ Project structure with Vite + React + TypeScript
- ‚úÖ Chakra UI and i18next integration
- ‚úÖ Testing setup with Vitest
- ‚úÖ Basic Hello World app with language switching

**What's Missing:** We need to transition from the hello world prototype to the actual Family Recipe App features described in the specs.

## Proposed Next Five Stories

### 1. **Create Main App Layout and Navigation**
Create the three-section layout described in the spec: "Start cooking" button, "Coming up" meal list, and "All recipes" section. This establishes the core app structure.

### 2. **Implement Recipe Data Model and Local Storage**
Define TypeScript interfaces for recipes and set up local storage persistence. This is foundational for all recipe-related features.

### 3. **Build Recipe Browser with Search**
Create the recipe browser page where users can view, search, and filter recipes. Include basic CRUD operations for recipes.

### 4. **Add Recipe Form for Creating/Editing Recipes**
Implement the form interface to add new recipes and edit existing ones, with proper validation and i18n support.

### 5. **Create Basic Meal Planning Interface**
Build the "Coming up" meal list functionality and basic meal planning features, laying groundwork for the weekly planner.

## Rationale

These stories follow a logical progression:
1. **Layout first** - establishes the app structure users will navigate
2. **Data foundation** - enables all recipe functionality 
3. **Recipe management** - core feature for browsing and managing recipes
4. **Recipe creation** - allows users to populate the app with content
5. **Meal planning basics** - begins the meal planning feature set

This sequence ensures each story builds on the previous ones while delivering incrementally valuable functionality. The user will be able to add recipes and start planning meals by story #5.

Would you like me to proceed with creating these stories as markdown files in the `` folder?

Hey there, I am connected to Agility and what is the user doing that?

---

_**Assistant**_

I can help you check your Agility connection and see what user information is available. Let me query the current user details from Agility. Great! You're successfully connected to Agility. Here's what I can see about your current user:

**Current Agility User:**
- **Name**: Hes Siemelink
- **Email**: Hes.Siemelink@digital.ai
- **Username**: Hes.Siemelink@digital.ai
- **Nickname**: Hes
- **Agility Host**: https://www7.v1host.com/V1Production

You're connected to the V1Production environment on Digital.ai Agility. This means you can use Agility-related commands to:

- Get work item details
- View project information
- Access your assigned tasks and stories
- Query team and project data

Is there something specific you'd like to do with your Agility connection? For example, I can help you:
- Look up specific work items
- Check your assigned tasks
- Get project information
- Or any other Agility-related queries

Just let me know what you'd like to explore!

_**User**_

Yep, that's me! To look at a workitem, do you need a ticket number or how does it work

---

_**Assistant**_

Great question! Yes, to look at a specific work item in Agility, I need a work item ID or number. Here's how it works:

**To get work item details, I need:**
- **Work Item ID/Number** - This could be something like "B-12345", "S-67890", or just a numeric ID like "12345"

**Example usage:**
```
Can you show me work item B-12345?
```
or
```
What's the status of ticket 67890?
```

The work item ID is usually displayed in Agility's interface and might be:
- A story number (like S-12345)
- A backlog item number (like B-67890) 
- A defect number (like D-11111)
- Or sometimes just a plain number

**If you don't have a specific work item ID**, you could:
1. Check your Agility dashboard/workspace for any assigned items
2. Look at recent work items you've been working on
3. Search for work items by project or sprint

Do you have a specific work item number you'd like me to look up? Or would you like help finding work items you're assigned to or involved with?

Let's take a look at E-19733. Can you tell me what the Sub-features it has beneath it

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll look up work item E-19733 for you and check what sub-features it contains. I can see that E-19733 is an Epic titled "Deprecate Delivery Insights" but the API response doesn't show the sub-features directly. The work item details show:

**Epic E-19733: "Deprecate Delivery Insights"**
- **Type**: Epic
- **Status**: Unknown
- **Description**: "We're removing Delivery Insights from our offering"
- **Created**: August 15, 2025
- **Modified**: August 15, 2025

The description mentions there's an overview PowerPoint presentation available on SharePoint.

Unfortunately, the current API response doesn't include the child work items (sub-features) in the structure. The Agility MCP integration I have access to can only retrieve individual work item details, but doesn't seem to have a method to fetch child/related work items directly.

To see the sub-features, you would typically need to:
1. Look at this Epic in the Agility web interface where it would show the hierarchy
2. Or provide me with specific sub-feature work item IDs if you know them

Is there a specific sub-feature work item number you'd like me to look up, or would you like me to help with something else regarding this Epic?
