# Later Backlog

This folder contains stories and tasks that have been deprioritized by the Product Owner. Stories here are not part of the active development cycle but may be reconsidered in future iterations.

## Purpose

- **Deferred Features**: Stories moved here when Product Owner decides to postpone implementation
- **Future Considerations**: Ideas that may be revisited when priorities change
- **Scope Management**: Helps maintain focus on current sprint objectives

## Management

- Stories are moved here by the **Product Owner** when priorities shift
- The **Planner Agent** should review this folder when creating new stories to avoid duplicates
- Stories may be moved back to `todo` when Product Owner decides to prioritize them

## Contents

Stories in this folder represent work that was once considered but is currently not planned for implementation.
