# Planner Improvements

## Ideas for Enhancement

- Week tracking number. Apart from the title, weeks get numbers. This is a global counter. A new week gets the number of the last known week plus 1. 

- Make Meal titles editable

- Add 'Cook' and 'Day' fields to Meal. They are displayed in the meal list and are editable. Cook has the name of the family member who will prepare it; it is plain text and has auto-complete drop down with all previous values entered as 'Cook'. 'Day' is a drop down with days of the week (localized!)
