# Setup Data Persistence Layer

## Description
Establish the foundational data persistence infrastructure using localStorage that will support recipe database and meal planning functionality.

## Technical Requirements
- Implement base `StorageService` interface for localStorage operations
- Create TypeScript data models: `Recipe`, `ComidasWeek`, `Comida`, `FamilyMember`
- Add data validation using zod schemas per architecture spec
- Implement JSON serialization with proper error handling
- Create generic CRUD operations for localStorage entities
- Add sample data initialization mechanism

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `StorageService` interface defined with generic CRUD methods
- [ ] All core data models implemented with TypeScript interfaces
- [ ] Zod validation schemas protect against data corruption
- [ ] Sample recipe data can be initialized from architecture spec
- [ ] localStorage operations handle errors gracefully
- [ ] Data models follow architecture specification exactly

## Priority
ðŸ”¥ **Critical** - Foundation for both recipe database and meal planning

## Estimation
**Medium** (2-3 days)

## Dependencies
- None (foundational infrastructure)

## Success Metrics
- Data persists correctly across browser sessions
- Type safety prevents data corruption
- Easy to extend for additional entity types
