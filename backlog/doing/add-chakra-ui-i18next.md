# Story: Add Chakra UI and i18next

## Description
Install and configure Chakra UI for styling and i18next for multilingual support in the project.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Chakra UI is installed and ready to use in the app
- [x] i18next is installed and basic configuration is present
- [x] The app renders with Chakra UI components and supports at least two languages

## Implementation Notes
- Installed Chakra UI and dependencies (@chakra-ui/react, @emotion/react, @emotion/styled, framer-motion)
- Installed i18next packages (react-i18next, i18next, i18next-browser-languagedetector)
- Created i18n.ts configuration with English, Spanish, and Dutch translations
- Updated main.tsx to include ChakraProvider with defaultSystem
- Updated App.tsx to use Chakra UI components (Box, Button, Heading, Text, VStack, HStack)
- Added language switcher using buttons with bold text to indicate current language (better visibility than solid variant)
- Verified project builds successfully

## Ready for Acceptance
Product Owner: Please review the implementation. Chakra UI and i18next are configured and working.

**To test:**
1. Navigate to the project: `cd implementation/family-recipe-app`
2. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
3. Open your browser to the URL shown (typically http://localhost:5173)
4. You should see the app using Chakra UI styling with "Hello World" and "Welcome" messages
5. Test the language switching buttons (English, Espa√±ol, Nederlands) - text should change accordingly and current language should be shown in bold
