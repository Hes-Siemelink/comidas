# Task: Setup Basic Routing Structure

## Description
Implement basic routing infrastructure using React Router to support navigation between different sections of the Family Recipe App, enabling the home page sections to link to their respective feature pages.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Install and configure React Router DOM
- [ ] Create basic route structure with Home route as default
- [ ] Add placeholder routes for Recipe Database, Meal Planner, and Cooking Assistant
- [ ] Implement navigation wrapper that preserves language switching functionality
- [ ] Update App component to use router-based navigation
- [ ] All routes support internationalization (i18next)
- [ ] Routing works on mobile devices and is accessible

## Technical Notes
- Use React Router v6 for modern routing patterns
- Implement BrowserRouter as the main router wrapper
- Create route definitions for: `/`, `/recipes`, `/planner`, `/cooking`
- Add placeholder components for each route that can be enhanced later
- Preserve existing Chakra UI and i18next setup
- Ensure proper TypeScript integration
- Consider lazy loading for future performance optimization

## Dependencies
- Requires React Router DOM package installation
- Must maintain compatibility with existing Chakra UI and i18next setup
