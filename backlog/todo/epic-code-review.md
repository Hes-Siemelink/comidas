# Code Review - Architectural Implementation Plan

## Description

This story has been broken down into focused technical stories to address specific architectural concerns identified in recent development. Each story targets a distinct aspect of the code architecture.

## Breakdown Stories

### üèóÔ∏è **Core Architecture Stories**

1. **[refactor-planner-context-api.md](./refactor-planner-context-api.md)** - Simplify PlannerContext API surface (20+ functions ‚Üí ~15)
2. **[improve-component-dependency-injection.md](./improve-component-dependency-injection.md)** - Convert components to pure/smart patterns  
3. **[standardize-week-transition-logic.md](./standardize-week-transition-logic.md)** - Unify completion flow logic

### üîç **Quality & Testing Stories** 

4. **[code-quality-internal-review.md](./code-quality-internal-review.md)** - File-by-file code quality improvements
5. **[enhance-testing-architecture.md](./enhance-testing-architecture.md)** - Align tests with architectural patterns

## Implementation Order

**Phase 1 (Foundation):** Stories #1-3 address core architectural debt  
**Phase 2 (Quality):** Stories #4-5 improve maintainability and validation

## Completion Criteria

- [ ] All breakdown stories moved to `done/`  
- [ ] No architectural violations in code review guidelines
- [ ] Test coverage maintains 80%+ during refactoring
- [ ] All existing functionality preserved
