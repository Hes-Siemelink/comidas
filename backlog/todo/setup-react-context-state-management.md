# Setup React Context State Management

## Description  
Implement the React Context architecture for state management across recipe database and meal planning features, following the service layer pattern defined in architecture.

## Technical Requirements
- Create `RecipeContext` with recipe CRUD operations and search
- Create `ComidasWeekContext` with meal planning operations
- Create `FamilyContext` for member management
- Implement custom hooks: `useRecipes`, `useRecipe`, `useComidasWeek`, `useFamilyMembers`
- Connect contexts to data persistence layer services
- Add proper TypeScript typing for all context providers
- Implement loading states and error handling patterns

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `RecipeContext` provides recipe CRUD operations
- [ ] `ComidasWeekContext` handles meal planning state
- [ ] `FamilyContext` manages family member data
- [ ] Custom hooks encapsulate data fetching logic
- [ ] All contexts properly typed with TypeScript
- [ ] Loading and error states handled consistently
- [ ] Context providers wrap app at appropriate level

## Priority
ðŸŸ¨ **High** - Required foundation for all UI components

## Estimation
**Medium** (2-3 days)

## Dependencies
- Data persistence layer setup

## Success Metrics
- Components can access shared state easily
- Data changes propagate correctly across UI
- Performance is acceptable for typical usage
