## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Install and configure React Icons or Lucide React for icon library
- [ ] Create reusable Icon component wrapper for consistent styling

- Ensure proper TypeScript interfaces for icon props
- Consider icon accessibility guidelines and screen reader support
- Test icon rendering across different themes and color modes

## Dependencies
