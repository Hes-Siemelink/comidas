# Setup React Context State Management

## Description  
Implement the React Context architecture for state management across recipe database and meal planning features, following the service layer pattern defined in architecture.

## Technical Requirements
- Create `RecipeContext` with recipe CRUD operations and search
- Create `ComidasWeekContext` with meal planning operations
- Create `FamilyContext` for member management
- Implement custom hooks: `useRecipes`, `useRecipe`, `useComidasWeek`, `useFamilyMembers`
- Connect contexts to data persistence layer services
- Add proper TypeScript typing for all context providers
- Implement loading states and error handling patterns

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] `PlannerContext` provides week plan state and updater
- [x] Context provider wraps app at the top level
- [x] Custom hook (`usePlanner`) exposes context state and updater
- [x] Components (e.g., PlannerPage) can read and update shared state
- [x] All context code is properly typed with TypeScript
- [x] All tests pass and context is covered in test wrappers

## Priority
ðŸŸ¨ **High** - Required foundation for all UI components

## Estimation
**Medium** (2-3 days)

## Dependencies
- Data persistence layer setup

## Success Metrics
- Components can access shared state easily
- Data changes propagate correctly across UI
- Performance is acceptable for typical usage

## Ready for Acceptance

### Product Owner Instructions
- No code review required; acceptance is based on feature integration and test coverage.
- All tests must pass before acceptance (assumed).
- You may request the Architect Agent to review the implementation for architectural soundness.
- Confirm that the Planner context is available throughout the app and properly typed with TypeScript.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Planner context is implemented and integrated at the app level
- [x] Shared state is accessible in child components
- [x] All related tests pass
- [x] TypeScript typing is enforced
- [x] Architect Agent review (optional)

If all criteria are met, please move this story to `done/`.
