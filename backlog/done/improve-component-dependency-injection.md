# Improve Component Dependency Injection

## Description

Refactor planner UI components to follow dependency injection principles, reducing tight coupling to PlannerContext and improving reusability and testability.

## âœ… **COMPLETED** - All Acceptance Criteria Met

### ğŸ“‹ **QuickPlanningForm Enhancement**

- [x] **Remove context coupling**: Component should receive all data/behavior via props
- [x] **Generic meal addition**: Accept `onAddMeal(title: string)` callback instead of context access
- [x] **Week-agnostic design**: Works with any week type (current, planned, archived)
- [x] **Improved testability**: Can be tested with mock props instead of context mocking

### ğŸ“‹ **DraggableListItem Isolation**

- [x] **Pure component design**: No context dependencies, all props injected
- [x] **Callback-based actions**: `onEdit`, `onDelete`, `onToggleComplete` via props
- [x] **Data through props**: Meal data and editing state from parent
- [x] **Reusable across contexts**: Works outside meal planning if needed

### ğŸ“‹ **WeekDisplay Simplification**

- [x] **Smart component pattern**: Handles context access and business logic
- [x] **Delegate to pure components**: Pass down data and callbacks to child components
- [x] **Reduce direct context usage**: Minimize the surface area of context interaction
- [x] **Clear data flow**: Parent fetches, children display and callback

### ğŸ“‹ **Component Testing**

- [x] **Unit test pure components**: Test with props, no context provider needed
- [x] **Integration test smart components**: Test context interaction separately
- [x] **Improve test coverage**: Target 85%+ for refactored components

## âœ… **IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE**

### **Components Refactored:**

1. **CheckableListItem** - Pure component with dependency injection
   - Receives callbacks via props: `onToggleComplete`, `onDelete`, `onEdit`
   - No direct context coupling
   - Comprehensive unit tests (9 test cases)

2. **DraggableListItem** - Pure component with callback-based design
   - Receives meal positioning and reorder callbacks via props
   - Delegates meal interaction to CheckableListItem
   - Full keyboard navigation testing (5 test cases)

3. **WeekDisplay** - Smart component with clear data flow
   - Handles context access and provides callback functions
   - Delegates to pure child components
   - Bridge pattern between context and UI components

### **Testing Achievement:**
- **17 new comprehensive tests** added for dependency injection validation
- **181 total tests passing** (100% success rate)
- **Components testable without complex context mocking**
- **Error handling and boundary condition coverage**

### **Architecture Benefits:**
- **Improved Reusability**: Components work outside specific contexts
- **Better Testability**: Pure components test with simple props
- **Cleaner Separation**: Smart/dumb component pattern implemented
- **Reduced Coupling**: Context dependencies isolated to smart components

## Technical Focus

**Before (Coupled):**
```tsx
const CheckableListItem = ({ meal }: Props) => {
  const { toggleMealCompletion, deleteMeal, editMeal } = usePlanner()
  // Direct context coupling
}
```

**After (Injected):**
```tsx
const CheckableListItem = ({ 
  meal, 
  onToggleComplete, 
  onDelete, 
  onEdit 
}: Props) => {
  // Pure component with injected behavior
}
```

## Priority

ğŸ”¥ **High** - Improves component architecture and enables better testing patterns
