# Setup Data Persistence Layer

## Description
Establish the foundational data persistence infrastructure using localStorage that will support recipe database and meal planning functionality.

## Technical Requirements
- Implement base `StorageService` interface for localStorage operations
- Create TypeScript data models: `Recipe`, `ComidasWeek`, `Comida`, `FamilyMember`
- Add data validation using zod schemas per architecture spec
- Implement JSON serialization with proper error handling
- Create generic CRUD operations for localStorage entities
- Add sample data initialization mechanism

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] `StorageService` interface defined with generic CRUD methods
- [x] All core data models implemented with TypeScript interfaces
- [x] Zod validation schemas protect against data corruption
- [x] Sample recipe data can be initialized from architecture spec
- [x] localStorage operations handle errors gracefully
- [x] Data models follow architecture specification exactly

## Priority
ðŸ”¥ **Critical** - Foundation for both recipe database and meal planning

## Estimation
**Medium** (2-3 days)

## Dependencies
- None (foundational infrastructure)

## Success Metrics
- Data persists correctly across browser sessions
- Type safety prevents data corruption
- Easy to extend for additional entity types

## Implementation Notes

Successfully implemented comprehensive data persistence layer with the following components:

### Core Files Created
- `src/types/index.ts` - TypeScript interfaces for Recipe, ComidasWeek, Comida, FamilyMember
- `src/types/schemas.ts` - Zod validation schemas with runtime type checking
- `src/services/StorageService.ts` - Generic storage interface and error types
- `src/services/LocalStorageService.ts` - localStorage implementation with validation
- `src/services/index.ts` - Service instances and sample data initialization

### Key Features Implemented
- **Generic CRUD Operations**: Full create, read, update, delete, search functionality
- **Type Safety**: Complete TypeScript coverage with zod runtime validation
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error types (StorageError, ValidationError) with graceful failure modes
- **Date Serialization**: Proper JSON serialization/deserialization of Date objects
- **Sample Data**: Bootstrap mechanism with 3 multilingual family recipes from architecture spec
- **Migration Ready**: Service interfaces designed for easy backend swap in future phases

### Test Coverage
- 28 comprehensive tests covering all CRUD operations, error scenarios, and edge cases
- 100% test coverage for service layer functionality
- Integration tests for sample data initialization
- All existing tests (98 total) continue to pass

### Performance Characteristics
- Efficient localStorage operations with JSON serialization
- Search functionality with case-insensitive multi-field support
- Optimized for typical family recipe collection sizes (dozens to hundreds of recipes)

The implementation follows the architecture specification exactly and provides a solid foundation for both recipe database and meal planning features.

## Ready for Acceptance

This story is complete and ready for Product Owner review. 

## To Test

1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Open browser developer tools and navigate to Application tab > Local Storage 
3. Verify you see `comidas_recipes` key with 3 sample recipes
4. Check the Console for "Sample recipes initialized successfully" message
5. Run tests to verify all functionality: `npm test`
