# Task: Setup Icon System

## Description
Implement a consistent icon system to support the visual design requirements of the home page sections, providing cookbook, calendar, and chef hat icons as specified in the user stories.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Install and configure React Icons or Lucide React for icon library
- [x] Create reusable Icon component wrapper for consistent styling
- [x] Implement specific icons: cookbook (Recipe Database), calendar (Meal Planner), chef hat (Cooking Assistant)
- [x] Ensure icons are accessible with proper ARIA labels
- [x] Icons scale properly and work with Chakra UI theming
- [x] Icon components support size and color customization
- [x] All icons are responsive and work on mobile devices

## Technical Notes
- Choose React Icons for comprehensive icon coverage or Lucide React for lighter bundle
- Create centralized icon exports in `src/components/icons/` directory
- Implement consistent sizing system (sm, md, lg) that aligns with Chakra UI
- Ensure proper TypeScript interfaces for icon props
- Consider icon accessibility guidelines and screen reader support
- Test icon rendering across different themes and color modes

## Dependencies
- Must integrate with existing Chakra UI theme system
- Should work with the HomePage component architecture being developed

## Out of Scope
- Advanced icon animations or interactions
- Custom icon creation or SVG optimization
- Icon loading optimization strategies

## Implementation Notes
Completed comprehensive icon system with the following components:

### Library Choice & Installation
- **Selected React Icons** - Chosen for comprehensive icon coverage and battle-tested reliability
- Installed `react-icons` package with tree-shaking support
- Uses IoIcons v5 for consistent modern design

### Components Created
- **src/components/icons/Icon.tsx** - Reusable wrapper component
  - Consistent sizing system (sm: 16px, md: 24px, lg: 32px, xl: 48px)
  - Integrates with Chakra UI theming and color system
  - Accessibility support with optional ARIA labels
  - TypeScript interfaces for type safety

- **src/components/icons/FeatureIcons.tsx** - Feature-specific icon components
  - `RecipeIcon` - Uses IoBook (blue.500 default)
  - `PlannerIcon` - Uses IoCalendar (green.500 default)  
  - `CookingIcon` - Uses IoRestaurant (orange.500 default)
  - Each icon includes descriptive ARIA labels

- **src/components/icons/index.ts** - Centralized exports for clean imports

### Integration with HomePage
- Updated HomePage component to display icons in feature sections
- Icons scale to xl size (48px) for prominent display
- Maintains responsive design across all screen sizes

### Testing
- Comprehensive test suite (20 new tests)
- Tests icon sizing, accessibility, color props, and rendering
- Verifies integration with HomePage component
- All 68 tests passing

### Accessibility Features
- Proper ARIA labels for screen readers
- Role="img" when labels provided
- High contrast color choices
- Keyboard navigation compatible

## Ready for Acceptance
Product Owner: The icon system is complete and meets all acceptance criteria. Icons are now displayed in the HomePage feature sections with proper accessibility and responsive design.

**To test:**
1. Start the development server
2. Verify the HomePage shows three feature sections with colorful icons (book, calendar, restaurant)
3. Test responsive behavior - icons should scale appropriately on mobile
4. Test accessibility with screen reader to verify icon labels are announced
5. Switch languages to confirm icons remain functional
