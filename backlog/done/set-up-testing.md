# Story: Set Up Testing

## Description
Add Vitest and React Testing Library to the project. Write a basic test for the Hello World component.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Vitest and React Testing Library are installed and configured
- [x] A test exists for the Hello World component
- [x] Tests run and pass successfully

## Implementation Notes
- Installed Vitest, React Testing Library, @testing-library/jest-dom, jsdom
- Created vitest.config.ts with jsdom environment and global test configuration
- Created setupTests.ts for jest-dom matchers
- Added test scripts to package.json (test, test:run)
- Created App.test.tsx with comprehensive tests for Hello World component including Chakra UI wrapper
- All tests pass successfully - Vitest works seamlessly with Vite/React/TypeScript stack

## Ready for Acceptance
Product Owner: Please review the testing implementation. Vitest and React Testing Library are configured and all tests pass.

**To test:**
1. Navigate to the project: `cd implementation/family-recipe-app`
2. Run the tests: `npm run test:run`
3. You should see 3 tests pass (Hello World message, welcome message, language toggle buttons)
4. Verify tests run quickly and without configuration issues
