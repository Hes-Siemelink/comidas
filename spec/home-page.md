# Home Page Specification

## Goal
The Home Page serves as the entry point to the comidas application, providing users with access to core features such as meal planning and recipe management. It enables users to select their preferred language, navigate to main sections, and view a summary of their current planning status.

## Sections and Functional Behavior

### 1. Language Selection Section
- Displays available languages for the application.
- The currently selected language is visually highlighted.
- When a user selects a different language, the application updates all visible text to the chosen language immediately.
- Language selection persists across sessions.

### 2. Main Navigation Section
- Presents navigation options for the primary features: [Meal Planner](./meal-planner-page.md) and [Recipe Database](./recipe-database-page.md).
- Each navigation option is clearly labeled and accessible.
- When a user clicks on the "Meal Planner" button, they are navigated to the Meal Planner page.
- When a user clicks on the "Recipe Database" button, they are navigated to the Recipe Database page.
- Navigation is immediate and does not require a page reload.

### 3. Current Planning Status Section
- Shows a summary of the user's current meal planning status (e.g., number of planned weeks, completed weeks, or meals planned).
- The summary updates automatically when the underlying data changes (such as completing a week or adding a meal).
- If no planning data exists, a message is displayed indicating that the user has not started planning yet.

### 4. Welcome Section
- Displays a welcome message to the user.
- The message is localized according to the selected language.
- May include a brief description of the application's purpose and features.

### 5. Accessibility and Responsiveness
- All interactive elements are accessible via keyboard and screen readers.
- The page layout adapts to different screen sizes and devices, ensuring usability on desktop and mobile.

## General Behavior
- All sections update dynamically in response to user actions and context changes.
- Navigation between sections and pages is seamless and preserves user context.
- The Home Page does not expose domain-specific logic; it only provides entry points and summary information.
