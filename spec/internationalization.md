# Internationalization Specification

## Goal
Define how the comidas application supports multiple languages (Spanish, Dutch, and English) with seamless language switching and culturally appropriate content presentation.

## Supported Languages

### Primary Languages
- **English (en)** - Default language and fallback
- **Spanish (es)** - Primary family language
- **Dutch (nl)** - Secondary family language

### Language Selection
- Language choice is prominently displayed on the home page
- Selected language is visually highlighted in the language switcher
- Language preference persists across sessions and device restarts

## Language Switching Behavior

### Immediate Updates
- All visible text updates immediately when language is changed
- No page reload required for language switching
- Current page context and user data are preserved during language change

### Persistence
- Language preference is stored locally on the device
- Setting persists across app sessions and browser restarts
- Language choice is remembered when returning to the application

### URL Integration
- Language preference may be reflected in URL structure (optional)
- Deep links work correctly regardless of language setting
- Bookmarks preserve language context when possible

## Content Localization

### User Interface Text
- All buttons, labels, and navigation elements are translated
- Form validation messages appear in the selected language
- Error messages and confirmations are localized

### User-Generated Content
- Recipe names can be entered in any language/script
- Meal names support multilingual input
- Week titles accept international characters and accents

### Date and Number Formatting
- Dates display according to language-specific conventions
- Numbers and measurements follow cultural norms
- Currency formatting (if applicable) uses appropriate symbols

## Cultural Adaptations

### Mexican/Spanish Context
- Recipe ingredients use Spanish names when appropriate
- Cooking terminology reflects Mexican culinary traditions
- Measurement units align with Mexican cooking practices

### Dutch Context
- Recipe terminology uses Dutch culinary language
- Ingredient names reflect Dutch grocery shopping context
- Cooking measurements follow European standards

### Family-Friendly Approach
- Interface accommodates family members of different language proficiencies
- Simple, clear language appropriate for children
- Consistent terminology across all sections

## Technical Implementation

### Text Management
- All user-facing text is externalized from code
- Translation keys follow consistent naming conventions
- Missing translations gracefully fall back to English

### Dynamic Content
- User input validation works across all supported languages
- Search functionality handles accented characters and special characters
- Sorting and filtering work correctly with international text

### Performance Considerations
- Language resources load efficiently
- Switching languages doesn't impact application performance
- Minimal data transfer when changing languages

## Accessibility and Language

### Screen Reader Support

- Content language is properly marked for assistive technology
- Text direction and reading order appropriate for each language

### Font and Character Support
- All languages display with appropriate fonts

## Future Extensibility

### Additional Languages

- Translation workflow accommodates new language additions
- Family language preferences can expand over time

### Regional Variations
- Framework supports regional variants (e.g., Mexican vs. Peninsular Spanish)
- Cultural customizations can be language-specific
- Local preferences can override general language settings
