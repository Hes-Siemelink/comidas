# Architecture Overview

This document describes the initial technology choices and architectural direction for the Family Recipe App.

## Frontend

- **Framework**: React (with Vite for fast development and prototyping)
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Component Library**: Chakra UI (for accessible, modern, and customizable UI components)
- **Internationalization**: i18next (for multilingual support)

## Data Storage

- **Prototype Phase**: Local storage or IndexedDB for single-user, offline-first experience
- **Future Expansion**: Plan for backend integration (Node.js/Express or Firebase) to support multi-user features and cloud sync

## Testing

- **Unit/Integration Testing**: Vitest (Vite-native) and React Testing Library

## Rationale

- The stack is chosen for rapid prototyping, strong community support, and easy transition to mobile or backend integration in the future.
- Chakra UI provides a great developer experience and ensures accessibility out of the box.

## Testing Rationale

Vitest is chosen over Jest because it is designed for Vite/ESM projects, requires minimal configuration, and works seamlessly with React, TypeScript, and static assets. It provides a fast, modern, and reliable testing experience for this stack.

This architecture will be reviewed and updated as the project evolves and requirements change.
