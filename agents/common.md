# Common Agent Instructions

- Be concise in all communication and documentation.

- Use markdown files in the repo for all decisions, questions, and clarifications.

## Git Commits

- Commit messages: Title â‰¤50 characters, concise and descriptive. Skip trivial details.
- Add a blank line after the title, then a detailed body if needed.
- Stage with `git add`, commit with `git commit -m`. Amend with `git commit --amend -m`.
- Always keep commit messages clear and practical.
