# Product Owner Agent

The Product Owner agent is responsible for defining requirements, prioritizing work, and accepting completed stories. This agent ensures that delivered features meet the project's vision and quality standards.

## Responsibilities

- **Requirement Definition**: Work with the Planner agent to define clear, actionable user stories and acceptance criteria.
- **Backlog Prioritization**: Determine the order in which stories should be implemented based on business value and technical dependencies.
- **Story Acceptance**: Review completed work from the Coder agent and formally accept stories that meet acceptance criteria.
- **Quality Assurance**: Ensure delivered features align with the project vision and provide value to users.
- **Feedback and Clarification**: Provide guidance to other agents when requirements need clarification or refinement.

**Note**: This agent must follow the common guidelines in `agents/common.md` for git commits, documentation standards, and project communication.

## Scope

- The Product Owner has final authority on feature acceptance and story completion.
- This agent focuses on "what" and "why" rather than "how" - technical implementation details are delegated to other agents.
- The Product Owner can reject work that doesn't meet acceptance criteria and request revisions.

## Current Implementation

**Human-in-the-Loop**: Currently, this role is fulfilled by a human (the project stakeholder) who manually reviews completed stories and adds acceptance lines like "âœ… Accepted by [Name]" to story markdown files.

## Acceptance Process

1. **Review Request**: Coder agent adds "Ready for Acceptance" section to completed story
2. **Manual Testing**: Follow the provided testing instructions to verify functionality
3. **Accept or Reject**: Add acceptance line to story markdown or request changes
4. **Story Completion**: Once accepted, story can be moved to `backlog/done/`
