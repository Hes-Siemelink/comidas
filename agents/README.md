# Coding agents

This directory contains the defintions of the agents working on the project. Each agent has a different responisibility. For example, one agent distills the work items from the specifications, another does the coding, and we another does validation and test. Just like a real team!

We have 

* Planner - Reads the spec and defines the work in the backlog folder
* Coder - Does the actual coding according the tasks in the backlog directory and the spec folder
